<h4>About This Application</h4>
<p>
    A chat application, also known as an instant messaging system,
    is a tool that allows many individuals to communicate with each other almost simultaneously.
    In the modern world, communication is often made between a client and a server. A client will usually connect to a
    server and start to communicate based on addresses. Thus, when using a distributed system, it requires more
    tools and framework to work efficiently and effectively.
</p>
<h4>What is a Distributed Server?</h4>
<p>
    In computer science, a distributed system is a form of computing that utilizes multiple components
    on different machines. It does this in such a way as to be able to coordinate calculations to appear on one end-
    userâ€™s system.
    A distributed system generally has two system functions where either each machine works towards a common goal
    or each machine has its own end-user with shared resources and communication services. All components run along
    with each other and there is no global clock among each component. In saying this, most distributed systems can
    remain obscure. However, they do have their benefits as there is easy horizontal scalability, reliability, and
    performance increases.
