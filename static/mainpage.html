                <p class="info">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chat application, also known as an
                    instant messaging system, is a tool that allows
                    many individuals to communicate with each
                    other almost simultaneously. In the modern
                    world, communication is often made between a
                    client and a server. A client will usually connect
                    to a server and start to communicate based on
                    addresses. Thus, when using a distributed
                    system, it requires more tools and framework
                    to work efficiently and effectively.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">What is a Distributed Server?</p>
                <p class="info">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computer science, a distributed
                    system is a form of computing that utilizes
                    multiple components on different machines. It
                    does this in such a way as to be able to
                    coordinate calculations to appear on one end-
                    userâ€™s system. A distributed system generally
                    has two system functions where either each
                    machine works towards a common goal or
                    each machine has its own end-user with
                    shared resources and communication services.
                    All components run along with each other and
                    there is no global clock among each
                    component. In saying this, most distributed
                    systems can remain obscure. However, they
                    do have their benefits as there is easy
                    horizontal scalability, reliability, and
                    performance increases.</p>
